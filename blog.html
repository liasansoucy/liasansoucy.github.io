<p>In December of 2013, we began planning a trip with our best friends, The Bs. We decided to take both families out to Mount Rushmore, which then became a trip to Yellowstone. It took a lot of planning and many family meetings, and in June we took the two weeks to drive out to Wyoming and back. It was the most wonderful, amazing trip and we had a fabulous time. We took two families, one with 7 and the other with 5 people, our dog and two campers. For the most part, the trip went very smoothly, but the few times things went a little off plan, were either learning experiences, or an unexpected side adventure or both.

 

Before we went, each family had a binder of all the campgrounds, maps, printouts of planned activities, etc. We had shirts embroidered with a logo and our last names with Great Western Adventure on them, and all 12 of us wore them on certain days. Day 1 to start, a day in Yellowstone, and then the last day. (Laundry was not something we did very often!) We were on the road for 16 days and starting in Kentucky, we went through Indiana, stopped the first night in Illinois, then to Iowa, then the next three nights in South Dakota (which was incredibly beautiful). From there we went to Wyoming, and into Yellowstone. We did a day trip into Montana (to do a trail ride and cowboy cookout), then the way home we went down to Colorado, across Kansas, then across Missouri finally back to our home state of Kentucky. 

Because of my work and other life issues, I was not able to do as much of the planning as I would have liked, and most of it fell to The Bs. They did an amazing job and we are incredibly grateful to them for planning it, and had a great time being with them. In fact, most of the camping and hiking we do is with them. 
        
One of the reasons I wanted to write this blog was that we met some people who were new to camping that we helped when we could. We also noticed that there are a lot of big rigs with older couples in them, but not as many families anymore. Camping, even in a campground, is such a fun thing for kids and such a great family bonding time that it is sad that families are not doing it as much. We go camping pretty much every other weekend all summer long. Once you have enough gear to get out there, camping is really cheap, and you can add more, and better, gear as you go along.  So get out there and have fun bonding with your kids and eating food on a stick cooked over a fire! </p>
